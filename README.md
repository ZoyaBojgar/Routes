This is a simple project I created to learn and practice React Router with a clean and responsive UI using Tailwind CSS. It helped me understand the basics of client-side routing in React.

What I Learned:
Setting up React Router DOM in a React app.
Creating and linking multiple pages (Home, About, Contact, etc.).
Using <BrowserRouter>, <Routes>, <Route>, and <NavLink>.
Applying active link styling with NavLink.
Styling the layout using Tailwind CSS.
